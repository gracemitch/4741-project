In this project, we aims to predict hourly electricity demand, based on previous electricity demand and current weather factors. This project will attempt to determine which weather factors significantly contribute to electricity demand, and whether the same forecasting techniques can be used to accurately predict electricity demand in different building types. (Copied from out project proposal) Specifically, we will try to relate weather in New York City and electricity demands of four buildings of different types in the city. 

To avhieve this goal, we will use data from two time series datasets. The first dataset is weather data collected at Central Park station in NYC, provided by National Center for Environmental Information. Central Parks is located near the grographical center of Manhattan Island and we believe weather at that station is representative of weather of the whole city. The weather dataset contains the following features which we believe are closely related to electricity demand: Dew Point Temperature (dewtemp), Dry Bulb Temperature (drytemp), Humidity (humidity), Precipitation (precip) and Wind Speed (wind speed). The second dataset is provided by Grace Mitchell, one of our team members. It contains time series electricity demands of a courthouse, an office building and two school buildings in the city. These are actually four datasets, as we will train four different models on each type of building. Each time series contains one-year data ranging from 7/1/2016 to 6/30/2017, and we will have all of them to have a uniform time interval of an hour. This is to ensure that time series from two datasets match each other and that they can be safely concatenated. We will build preliminary models on these datasets. If the variance turns out to be too high, we may reduce time interval to 15 or to 5 miniutes, as more data will help reduce variance. We deleted all time information from the dataset, while time in a day still remains as a feature. Thus, we will avoid working with time series. Potentially, we will add time in a day, season and weekday/weekend as features, but not date.

All data from December 8th and 9th was omitted due to the big amount of missing values in weather data. Another problem we encountered when cleaning up the data was that weather data was collected more frequently than one hour and was not “on the hour” for every day. The number of data points collected was inconsistent for each day, as the weather data was not always collected at the same time, or the same number of times every day. As a workaround, we decided to use data points collected that were nearest to “on the hour” (i.e. 12:51, 1:51, … 11:51) for each day. We think this problem will not cause a big affect on prediction accuracy because generally weather does not change in a a few minutes. Because of inconsistent time interval, a total of 12 data points were missing in the weather data, so 12 additional points were randomly duplicated. For each missing weather data point, the values were interpolated between previous and successive moments in time. Generally, many data points for precipitation and wind speed were missing, but this only occurred in approximately ¼ of the data set.

All features vectors were standardized by subtracting column mean and dividing them by column standard deviation. The output sets (electricity demands) were standardized in the same way. Then, data was randomly divided into two sets, with 80% of it put into the training set and 20% put into the test set.

We then trianed a preliminary model for each type of building.
