In this project, we aims to predict hourly electricity demand, based on previous electricity demand and current weather factors. This project will attempt to determine which weather factors significantly contribute to electricity demand, and whether the same forecasting techniques can be used to accurately predict electricity demand in different building types. (Copied from out project proposal) Specifically, we will try to relate weather in New York City and electricity demands of four buildings of different types in the city. 

To avhieve this goal, we will use data from two time series datasets. The first dataset is weather data collected at Central Park station in NYC, provided by National Center for Environmental Information. Central Parks is located near the grographical center of Manhattan Island and we believe weather at that station is representative of weather of the whole city. The second dataset is provided by Grace Mitchell, one of our team members. It contains time series electricity demands of a courthouse, an office building and two school buildings in the city. These are actually four datasets, as we will train four different models on each type of building. All time series contain one-year data ranging from 7/1/2016 to 6/30/2017, and they have a uniform time interval of 15 minutes. This is to ensure that time series from two datasets match each other and that they can be safely concatenated. 

The weather dataset contains the following series which we believe are closely related to electricity demand: Dew Point Temperature (dewtemp), Dry Temperature (drytemp), Humidity (humidity), Precipitation (precip) and Wind Speed (wind speed).
